# mmoore5553-flowplayer-fix

This was one time job to get flowplayer 3.6 version to work with the newest wordpress plugin. The user had just used the javascript file with
with the older version. So this version works with wordpress post loop  and checks the post creation date. Any date after 9-4-2015 it will automatically
add the JS file listed below. I have not included the flowplayer JS files as that is a paid plugin.

## Installation

Download as Zip and remove master from the name of file.  Just upload to wordpress.
